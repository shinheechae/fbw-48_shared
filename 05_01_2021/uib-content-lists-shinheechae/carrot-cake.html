  <h1>Easy Carrot Cake</h1>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle; list-style-position: inside;">
    <li>265g carrots (about 3), grated</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>235ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
    <li>265g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>335g light muscovado sugar</li>
    <li>100g natural yogurt</li>
    <li>1½ an orange, zested</li>
    <li>100g sultanas or raisins</li>
    <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>¼ fresh nutmeg</li>
    <li>100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. </li>
    <li>Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. </li>
    <li>Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.</li>
    <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins. </li>
    <li>Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. </li>
    <li>If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.</li>
    <li>To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. </li>
    <li>Add half the cream cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). </li>
    <li>Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing.</li>
    <li>Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. </li>
    <li>Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>
