### How to Cook Chicken a la Kiev

![Chicken a la kiev](/images/kiev.jpeg)

  - Combine 1/3 cup butter, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon spoon of finely cut chives. 
  - On a 6x6 inch piece of aluminum foil, spread mixture to about 2x3 inches. Place this mixture in the coldest section of your freezer and freeze until firm. This can be done ahead of time.
  - Remove skin of chicken breast. Separate meat from the bone. With one chicken breast you can make 2 pieces of "Ala Kiev".
  - Place chicken breast fillet between 2 pieces of wax paper. Pound until the meat is spread thinly. You may use the flat side of knife in pounding.
  - Rub the meat with minced garlic. Combine salt and pepper. Sprinkle on the meat.
  - Cut frozen butter into sticks, 3/4 inch thick by 2 1/2 inch length. Place 1 piece in the middle of the meat, sprinkle with parsley and roll like a drumstick.
  - Be sure the butter is well enveloped in the meat or it will ooze out while frying. Secure with a toothpick.
  - Cover thoroughly with flour, dip in beaten egg and roll on bread crumbs. Place in refrigerator for 1 hour to set the coating.
  - Deep fry for 5 minutes, remove the toothpicks and serve immediately. You can also use quick melt cheese to stuff in your chicken ala kiev.

# Recipe for Korean BBQ source

## Ingredients
for 2 servings

* 1 ½ lb ribeye steak (700 g), or any other well-marbled, tender cut
* 1 onion, 1/2 roughly chopped and 1/2 thinly sliced
* 3 cloves garlic cloves
* ½ pear, peeled and roughly chopped
* 3 spring onions, 1 cut into pieces and 2 sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
* 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* ⅓ cup soy sauce (80 g)
* 3 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seed, for serving
* 2 cups cooked rice (400 g), for serving
* Banchan (Korean side dishes), for serving (optional)

## Preparation
1. Slice the beef as thinly as you can, then set aside in a large bowl. Using frozen or cold beef will make the slicing easier.
2.  In a blender or food processor, blend the onion chunks, garlic, pear, green onion pieces, brown sugar, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil until smooth.
3. Pour the marinade over the beef, add the thinly sliced onion, then mix to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or overnight.
4.  Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat. Pat the meat dry.
5.  Being careful not to crowd the pan, sear the marinated beef and onions until browned. Sprinkle with the sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
6.  Serve with rice and side dishes.
7. Enjoy!
