        <p><strong>Udon</strong> (饂飩, usually written as うどん) is a type of thick, wheat-flour noodle used frequently in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cuisine"><strong><span title="Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan, washoku (和食), lit...">Japanese cuisine.</span></strong></a>It is often served hot as a noodle soup in its simplest form, as kake udon, in a mildly flavoured broth called kakejiru, which is made of dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or kakiage (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or aburaage, a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added. Shichimi can be added to taste. <br>

    The flavour of broth and topping vary from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth, made from dark soy sauce (koikuchi shōyu), is used in eastern Japan, and light brown broth, made from light soy sauce (usukuchi shōyu), is used in western Japan. This is noticeable in packaged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_noodle"><strong><span title="Instant noodles or instant ramen, are noodles sold in a precooked and dried block with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil.">instant noodles</span></strong></a>, which are often sold in two different versions for east and west. Currynanban is another popular variation, served in curry broth.</p>
