    <ul>
        <li>1 bag of Buldakbokkeum Myeon</li>
        <li>1 egg, large</li>
        <li>1 piece of Spring onion</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the noodles as per cooking instruction. The noodles still have to be fried a little bit. Drain the water but leave about 2 tablespoons of the water in the pot. Put the pot back onto the stove and add the prepared noodles back into it. Now add the cut spring onions, the sauce and the flakes and stir fry everything.</li>
        <li>Cut the pork belly into small pieces and fry it.</li>
        <li>Prepare the fried egg. The egg yolk should be a bit runny (it tastes better that way).</li>
        <li>Mix the pork belly with the noodles and your meal is ready.</li>
        <li>Caution: freaking spicy!! A glass of milk might be helpful!</li>
